ðŸ©º Skin Cancer and Skin Disease Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This project focuses on the automated detection and classification of skin cancer and various skin diseases using a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The goal is to assist early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes by leveraging image-based analysis techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project uses image classification techniques to distinguish between multiple types of skin conditions, including Melanoma, using both traditional ML algorithms and deep learning approaches with MobileNet as a feature extractor.

ðŸ§  Models Used
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Models
1) Decision Tree Classifier
2) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3) Random Forest Classifier
4) Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning
1)  MobileNet for feature extraction
2) Custom classification layers for multi-class skin disease classification

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled dermatoscopic images of the following skin conditions:
1) Actinic Keratosis
2) Atopic Dermatitis
3) Benign Keratosis
4) Dermatofibroma
5) Melanocytic Nevus
6) Melanoma
7) Squamous Cell Carcinoma
8) Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis
9) Vascular Lesion

ðŸš€ Features
1) Multi-class classification of 9 skin conditions
2) Pre-trained MobileNet for efficient deep learning
3) Comparison of ML vs DL model performances
4) Visualization of confusion matrix and training curves

ðŸ”§ Technologies
1) Python
2) TensorFlow / Keras
3) scikit-learn
4) Matplotlib / Seaborn
5) Mobilenet

ðŸ“Œ Future Work
Improve test accuracy further with model tuning
Add real-time detection interface (web/mobile app)
Explore other architectures like EfficientNet or ResNet
Implement Grad-CAM for explainable AI insights
